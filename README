What is this?

This is just a wrapper to the Haml html2haml utility modified slightly to work with javascript haml instead of ruby haml (https://github.com/creationix/haml-js).  Thanks to the peeps over there that made haml-js work!

Instructions:

gem install haml
gem install hpircot
gem install ruby_parser

html2hamljs {html file path} {desired haml file path}
